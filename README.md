# Research question and hypotheses
I am currently studying Information Science and working on the topic of variations in language. I want to find out the frequency of the "dan/als" mistake and look both at the "dan" mistake as the "als" mistake in social media posts of Twitter and to investigate whether there are any significant differences in the occurrence of this error across various age groups. I want to help readers understand when to use "dan" and "als" correctly. We should adhere to Dutch language standards. Nowadays, younger people in the Netherlands are struggling with the Dutch language. On social media, they tend to use a lot of abbreviations and often omit punctuation. This trend is not conducive to improving their Dutch language skills.

I believe that most people online use "dan" and "als" correctly, but I think younger individuals tend to make the "dan/als" mistake more frequently.
