# Background information
On this specific topic there was not any research done, but there is research done on the use of grammar and the correctness of grammar on social media, especially with verbs. The article of Bernts (2022) is about the frequency of grammar mistakes and their topic was specifically on verbs that sound the same, but are different in which tense they are used, and looks at the frequency of the mistake with verbs that end with "t", "d" or "dt". Those are words like "word/wordt", "gebeurt/gebeurd" en "rusten/rustten". They did this by looking at corpuses from WhatsApp and Facebook, looking specifically at younger people. This article found that if the verb is d-dominant that there was a low frequency of mistakes, but if the word was t-dominant or dt-dominant, the frequency of mistakes was much higher.[^1]
