# Method
The method I will be be using. I will be using a large dataset of Dutch twitter posts from https://huggingface.co/datasets/dutch_social. Which is a dataset that contains 271,342 tweet, where all the tweets are in the Dutch language. I will be filtering out tweets based on the most common degrees of comparison in Dutch which are: 
| goed | beter | best | 
| graag | liever | liefst |
| veel | meer | meest |
| weinig | minder | minst |
