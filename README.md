# The "dan/als" mistake in Twitter posts

## Abstract 
This project is about frequency the "dan/als" mistake in Dutch posts from Twitter between the different ages. We will be looking both at the "dan" mistake as the "als" mistake. This will be done using a dataset of Dutch Twitter posts and filtering out the posts with the "dan/als" mistake and filtering out the user's age and putting these statistics in a graph. (still need to add the results in short and the conclusion)
