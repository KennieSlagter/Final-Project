# Background information
On this specific topic, there was not any research done, but there is research done on the use of grammar and the correctness of grammar on social media, especially with verbs. The article of Bernts (2022) is about the frequency of grammar mistakes and their topic was specifically on verbs that sound the same, but are different in which tense they are used and looks at the frequency of the mistake with verbs that end with "t", "d" or "dt". Those are words like "word/wordt", "gebeurt/gebeurd" en "rusten/rustten". They did this by looking at corpora from WhatsApp and Facebook, looking specifically at younger people. This article found that if the verb is d-dominant, there was a low frequency of mistakes, but if the word was t-dominant or dt-dominant, the frequency of mistakes was much higher.[^1]

The second article by Verheijen, Spooren, and van Kemenade (2020) looked at the Dutch youth and their usage of computer-mediated language (CMC), and how well they do in school writing. They tested this by making 400 participants, all having different education levels write an essay and fill in a questionnaire about their CMC use. They found out that most participants can differentiate between the CMC language and the standard Dutch well. They found out that using CMC language on social media does not correlate to a worse formal Dutch language.[^2]
